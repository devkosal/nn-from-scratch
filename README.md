# nn_from_scratch

In this repo, we create neural networks from scratch in Python. The latest version of this repo is inspired by Jeremy Howard's fast.ai series where we use only standard python libraries, arrays from pytorch, non data science modules and random number generators to build a neural network library. 

If you intend to use the Airbnb data I used, you can access it [[here]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnblala1/data) (special access may be required). You can also modify the code to work with any dataset for regression you wish. 


## Requirements
- Python => 3.7
