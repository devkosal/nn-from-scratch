# nn_from_scratch

In this repo, we create neural networks from scratch in Python and Numpy. We primarily focus on a regression task but can be modified for classification as well. 

If you intend to use the Airbnb data I used, you can access it [[here]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnblala1/data) (special access may be required). You can also modify the code to work with any dataset for regression you wish. 


## Requirements
- Python => 3.6
- numpy => 1.14.5
